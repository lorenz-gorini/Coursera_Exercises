%NNCOSTFUNCTION Implements the neural network cost function for a two layer
%neural network which performs classification
%   [J grad] = NNCOSTFUNCTON(nn_params, hidden_layer_size, num_labels, ...
%   X, y, lambda) computes the cost and gradient of the neural network. The
%   parameters for the neural network are "unrolled" into the vector
%   nn_params and need to be converted back into the weight matrices. 
% 
%   The returned parameter grad should be a "unrolled" vector of the
%   partial derivatives of the neural network.
%
% Reshape nn_params back into the parameters Theta1 and Theta2 (they are one 
% after another), the weight matrices for our 2 layer neural network 
% (number of elements)
%ME: First it was just ONE SINGLE row with that size.  
% Now we reshaped into a matrix of those dimensions.
Theta1 = reshape(nn_params(1:hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1)), ...
                 hidden_layer_size, (input_layer_size + 1));

%These theta matrices are the weights corresponding to the first and
% the second hidden layer                
Theta2 = reshape(nn_params((1 + (hidden_layer_size * (input_layer_size + 1))):end), ...
                 num_labels, (hidden_layer_size + 1));

% Setup some useful variables
m = size(X, 1);  % = 5000
% input_layer_size = 400
% size(X) = 5000 x 400
         
% You need to return the following variables correctly 
J = 0;
Theta1_grad = zeros(size(Theta1));
Theta2_grad = zeros(size(Theta2));

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
%               following parts.
% ==============================
% Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
%         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
%         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
%         computed in ex4.m

% We add the "x0 = +1" at the beginning
X=[ones(m,1) X];
%-----------INITIALIZE A_2---------
% A_2 must be the matrix with the hidden nodes (columns) of the first layer for 
% all the samples (rows)
A_2 = zeros(m,hidden_layer_size);
% size(A_2)= 5000x25 poi diventaÂ  5000x26 grazie a x0=1
A_3 = zeros(hidden_layer_size,num_labels);
% size(A_3)= 25*10 
%---------

% ------First layer-----------
% cycle over all the samples
for i=1:m
  %node values of the first layer
  A_2(i,:)=sigmoid((Theta1*X(i,:)')');  %both row vectors
endfor
A_2=[ones(m,1) A_2];
% size(A_2) = 5000x26

%--------Second layer---------
%cycle over all the samples
for i=1:m;
  %node values of the first layer
  A_3(i,:)=sigmoid((Theta2*A_2(i,:)')');  %both row vectors
endfor
% size(A_3) = 5000x10   THIS DESCRIBES THE OUTPUT FOR EVERY SAMPLE 
% (actually it describes the probability that the picture 
% represents that specific label for every label i.e. 
% (0.8573,0.1231,0.0302,...)--> the output is the "label 0"=(1,0,0,0,0,...)

% when I consider y, I consider a vector with 0/1 
%size(output) = 5000x1

%Cost function
for c=1:num_labels
  output=(y==c);  % a column vector which contains: 
                  % 1 for all the samples with the "output == label c" , 
                  % 0 otherwise (they will be 1 in the other cycles)
  J=J+(-1/m)*( output'*(log(A_3(:,c))) + (1-output)'*(log(1-A_3(:,c))) );

%===============================
% Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
%         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should 
%         
%          return the partial derivatives of
%         
%          the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
%         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
%         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
%
%         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
%               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
%               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
%               cost function.
%
%         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
%               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
%               first time.
%
%    I need to transform y in a matrix for all the labels as rows
%     This way we obtain a matrix with 0s and 1s (for the correct label)

% Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
%
%         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
%               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
%               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
%               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.
