### Ex6: Support Vector Machines

I use Support Vector Machines to build a spam classifier.

### Ex7: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis

In the first part, I implement the K-means clustering algorithm and
apply it to compress an image. In the second part, I use principal
component analysis to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

### Ex8: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

I implement the anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network. 
In the second part, I use collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for movies.
