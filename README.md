# Coursera_Exercises
Completed exercises from "Machine Learning" course by Andrew NG (Coursera).

I personally coded the parts with the labels "YOUR CODE HERE" inside the folder Ex1, Ex2,..,Ex5

### Ex3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks

I implement one-vs-all logistic regression and neural
networks to recognize hand-written digits.

ex3.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through part 1
ex3 nn.m - Octave/MATLAB script that steps you through part 2
ex3data1.mat - Training set of hand-written digits
ex3weights.mat - Initial weights for the neural network exercise
submit.m - Submission script that sends your solutions to our servers
displayData.m - Function to help visualize the dataset
fmincg.m - Function minimization routine (similar to fminunc)
sigmoid.m - Sigmoid function
